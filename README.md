## CLEVR DatePicker
Datepicker with more options than the default Mendix Datepicker

## Features
Next to the standard functionality like a placeholder and input events this widget also supports:
- Show weeknumbers
- Disable days in the picker itself (e.g. only future days)
- Date ranges

It also takes all the date formatting and language from the Mendix session and validation messages on the input also work correctly.

## Usage
Simply drag the widget on a page with a date attribute and attach it to the widget
